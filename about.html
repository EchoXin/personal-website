        <p>Hi, my name is Ying Xin, a graduate student in Engineering Management Program at Northeastern University.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm doing an internship in Web Development Team at a research company called Protobrand. I have enthusiasm on web development. Because I enjoy the process of creating small pieces, fitting them together and built a website product finally.</p>
